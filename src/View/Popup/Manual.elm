## This manual


Click on the **Manual** button to show or hide the manual.

## Cells

There are two kinds of cells: code cells and markdown cells.
Code cells are used to write Elm code: 

  - expression to be evaluated, like `2 + 2` or `List.length [1,2,3]`. 
  - declarations, like `a = 2` or `b = [1,2,3]`
  - type definitions, like `type alias Point = { x : Float, y : Float }`
  - import statements, like `import List.Extra`, `import List.Extra as LE`, or `import List.Extra exposing (..)`

Markdown cells are used to write text.

The result of evaluating the code is shown below the code.

## Public versus private notebooks

Notebooks are either public or private.  Public notebooks are visible to all users.
To change the status of a notebook, click on the **Private** button in the notebook footer.

You can work with a pubic notebook that does not belong to you: edit and evaluate
cells, delete cells and make new ones. However, these changes will not be saved.
If you want to save changes to a public notebook, clone it (see below)  Cloning a notebook
creates a copy of the notebook that belongs to you.



Note the two buttons **Mine** and **Public** at the top of the notebook list (right-hand column).
Click on the **Mine**
button to show your documents. Click on **Public** to show public documents that do not
belong to you.


## Cloning a notebook

Public documents can be cloned by clicking on the **Clone** button in the footer.

You can also update a notebook that has been cloned: click on the **Update** button in the footer.
Updating a notebook brings in new material from the original source.
However this operation will overwrite any changes you have made to the clone.

## Working with data

Data can
be imported from a `.csv` file and stored in a variable using the command `readinto`.
The command `readinto foo` will store the file contents in the variable `foo`.
To visualize imported data, use the `chart` command, e.g.,
`chart timeseries columns:1 foo` to display a time series of the data in column 1
of `foo`, or `chart scatter columns:3,5 foo` for a scatter plot of the
data in columns 3 and 5..  See the public notebook
**Data, Charts, and Images** for examples.


## The Dataset Library

Elm notebooks has a library of sample data sets. One of these
is `jxxcarlson.stocks`.
To import it,  say `import jxxcarlson.stocks`.  The contents of
this dataset will be stored in the variable `jxxcarlson.stocks`
of the current notebook.  To store it in the variable `foo`, say
`import jxxcarlson.stocks as foo` instead. Again, see
the public notebook **Data, Charts, and Images** for examples.

To create a data set from a file on your computer, click
on the button 'New Data Set' in the footer.
In the reverse direction, you can export a data set to a file  with the
 command `export jxxcarlson.stocks`.
